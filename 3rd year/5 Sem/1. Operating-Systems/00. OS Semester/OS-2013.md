### **UNIT - I**

#### **Question 1(a):**
**(i) Process:**  
A process is an instance of a program in execution. It includes the program code, its activity, and the current state of the program (e.g., program counter, registers, and memory allocation). Processes are managed by the operating system and are the basic unit of work in a system.

**(ii) Thread:**  
A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads, which share the same memory and resources but can execute independently. Threads are used to achieve parallelism and improve performance.

**(iii) Kernel:**  
The kernel is the core part of an operating system. It manages system resources, hardware communication, and provides essential services to applications. It acts as a bridge between hardware and software.

**(iv) System Call:**  
A system call is a request made by a program to the operating system for a service, such as file operations, process control, or communication. It allows user-level processes to access kernel-level functions.

---

#### **Question 1(b):**
**Definition of Operating System:**  
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages hardware resources, provides common services for computer programs, and acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware.

**OS as a Resource Manager:**  
The OS manages resources like CPU, memory, disk space, and I/O devices. It allocates resources to processes, ensures fair and efficient use, and prevents conflicts between processes.

**Difference between Multiprogramming and Multiprocessing:**  
- **Multiprogramming:** Multiple programs are loaded into memory, and the CPU switches between them to maximize utilization. It does not imply multiple CPUs.
- **Multiprocessing:** Multiple CPUs or cores are used to execute multiple processes simultaneously, improving performance and throughput.

---

#### **OR**

#### **Question 1(a):**
**States of a Process:**  
A process can be in one of the following states:  
1. **New:** The process is being created.  
2. **Ready:** The process is waiting to be assigned to the CPU.  
3. **Running:** The process is being executed by the CPU.  
4. **Waiting:** The process is waiting for an event (e.g., I/O completion).  
5. **Terminated:** The process has finished execution.  

A state transition diagram can be used to represent these states and transitions.

---

#### **Question 1(b):**
**Services Provided by the OS:**  
1. **Process Management:** Creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.  
2. **Memory Management:** Allocation and deallocation of memory.  
3. **File Management:** Creation, deletion, and manipulation of files.  
4. **Device Management:** Managing I/O devices.  
5. **Security and Protection:** Ensuring data and system security.  
6. **User Interface:** Providing a way for users to interact with the system.

---

#### **Question 1(c):**
**(i) User Thread vs Kernel Thread:**  
- **User Thread:** Managed by user-level libraries. Faster to create and manage but lacks kernel support.  
- **Kernel Thread:** Managed by the OS. Slower to create but provides better concurrency and resource management.

**(ii) System Call vs Function Call:**  
- **System Call:** A request to the OS kernel for a service. It involves a context switch and is slower.  
- **Function Call:** A call within a program to execute a function. It does not involve the OS and is faster.

---

### **UNIT - II**

#### **Question 2(a):**
**Critical Section Problem:**  
The critical section problem occurs when multiple processes access shared resources concurrently, leading to race conditions. To solve this, processes must ensure mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded waiting.

**Semaphores:**  
Semaphores are synchronization tools used to solve the critical section problem. They are integer variables that are accessed via two atomic operations: `wait()` and `signal()`. A binary semaphore (mutex) ensures mutual exclusion.

---

#### **Question 2(b):**
**Dining-Philosophers Problem:**  
The problem involves five philosophers sitting around a table, each with a fork on either side. To eat, a philosopher needs two forks. The challenge is to prevent deadlock and starvation. A solution is to use semaphores to ensure that no two adjacent philosophers eat simultaneously.

---

#### **OR**

#### **Question 2(a):**
**Preemptive SJF Scheduling:**  
Using the given processes:  
- **Gantt Chart:** P1 (0-3), P2 (3-10), P3 (10-16), P4 (16-26), P1 (26-50)  
- **Average Waiting Time:** (0 + 0 + 5 + 6) / 4 = 2.75 ms  
- **Average Turnaround Time:** (24 + 7 + 11 + 16) / 4 = 14.5 ms  

---

#### **Question 2(b):**
**Scheduling:**  
Scheduling is the process of selecting which process to execute next on the CPU.  
- **Short-term Scheduling:** Decides which process to execute next.  
- **Long-term Scheduling:** Decides which processes to admit into the system.  

**Performance Criteria:**  
- CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.

---

### **UNIT - III**

#### **Question 3(a):**
**Deadlock:**  
A deadlock occurs when two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource held by the other.

**Necessary Conditions for Deadlock:**  
1. Mutual Exclusion  
2. Hold and Wait  
3. No Preemption  
4. Circular Wait  

---

#### **Question 3(b):**
**(i) Resource Allocation Graph:**  
A graphical representation of processes and resources, showing which processes are holding or waiting for resources. A cycle in the graph indicates a deadlock.

**(ii) Recovery from Deadlock:**  
- **Process Termination:** Kill one or more processes to break the deadlock.  
- **Resource Preemption:** Take resources from one process and give them to another.

---

#### **OR**

#### **Question 3(a):**
**Internal vs External Fragmentation:**  
- **Internal Fragmentation:** Wasted memory within a partition due to fixed-size allocation.  
- **External Fragmentation:** Wasted memory between partitions due to variable-size allocation.

---

#### **Question 3(b):**
**(i) Logical vs Physical Address Space:**  
- **Logical Address:** Generated by the CPU during execution.  
- **Physical Address:** Actual memory location accessed by the memory unit.

**(ii) Dynamic Linking:**  
Linking of shared libraries at runtime rather than compile time, reducing memory usage and improving flexibility.

---

### **UNIT - IV**

#### **Question 4(a):**
**Page Replacement Policies:**  
1. **FIFO:** Replace the oldest page.  
2. **LRU:** Replace the least recently used page.  
3. **Optimal:** Replace the page that will not be used for the longest time.  

---

#### **Question 4(b):**
**Page Fault:**  
A page fault occurs when a process tries to access a page not currently in memory. The OS handles it by:  
1. Finding a free frame or replacing a page.  
2. Loading the required page into memory.  
3. Updating the page table.  
4. Resuming the process.

---

#### **OR**

#### **Question 4:**
**(i) Demand Paging:** Pages are loaded into memory only when needed, reducing memory usage.  
**(ii) Segmentation with Paging:** Combines segmentation and paging for better memory management.  
**(iii) Thrashing:** Excessive page faults due to insufficient memory, degrading system performance.  
**(iv) Global vs Local Allocation:**
