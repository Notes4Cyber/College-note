Q.1 Consider the following set of process to be executed, with the arrival time and CPU burst time given in milliseconds. Calculate average waiting time and turn-around time using given scheduling algorithm. Draw Gantt chart for each type. 

| Process | Arrival Time | CPU Burst Time |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| P1      | 0            | 5              |
| P2      | 1            | 3              |
| P3      | 2            | 3              |
| P4      | 3            | 1              |

Q.3 On a disk with 1000 cylinders numbers 0 to 999. Compute the number of tracks and disk arms must move to satisfy all the requests in the disk queue. Assume, the latest request received was at track 345 and the head is moving towards track 0. The queue in FIFO order contains requests for the following tracks 123,874,692,475,105,376. Perform the computation for FIFO, SSTF and SCAN scheduling algorithms.

Q.4 Consider the following page reference string 1,2,3,4,5,3,4,1,6,7,8,7,8,9,7,8,9,5,4,5,4,2 with four frames. How many page faults would occur for the FIFO, Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm. (Assume all Frames are initially empty)

Q.5 Write in short for the following -
