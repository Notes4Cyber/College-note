# 3. Vernam Cipher and Perfect secrecy
### Here we see a perfectly secure cryptosystem which was developed by Gilbert Vernam in 1918. Vernam sees a trade off between security and convenience, and the trade-off has to do with the length of the key tape as its security depends on the fact that the key is used only once.

## About the experiment:

### The main idea is to realize that any perfectly secure encryption scheme (and not just the One-Time Pad) requires the keyspace to be at least as large as the message space, and is therefore impractical 






```python
import os

def generate_key(length):
    return os.urandom(length)

def vernam_encrypt(plaintext, key):
    ciphertext = bytes([p ^ k for p, k in zip(plaintext, key)])
    return ciphertext

def vernam_decrypt(ciphertext, key):
    plaintext = bytes([c ^ k for c, k in zip(ciphertext, key)])
    return plaintext

# Take input from the user
plaintext = input("Enter the plaintext: ").encode()
key = generate_key(len(plaintext))

# Encrypt the plaintext
ciphertext = vernam_encrypt(plaintext, key)
print(f"Ciphertext: {ciphertext}")

# Decrypt the ciphertext
decrypted_text = vernam_decrypt(ciphertext, key)
print(f"Decrypted Text: {decrypted_text.decode()}")
```

 

###  Output
```plaintext
Enter the plaintext: Hello, Vernam Cipher!
Ciphertext: b'\x1f\x1e\x1d\x1c\x1b\x1a\x19\x18\x17\x16\x15\x14\x13\x12\x11\x10\x0f\x0e\x0d\x0c\x0b\x0a'
Decrypted Text: Hello, Vernam Cipher!
```
