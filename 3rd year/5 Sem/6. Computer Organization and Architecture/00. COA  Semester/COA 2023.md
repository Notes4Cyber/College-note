                               PART B

Q.1, Draw the block diagram of a dual 4-to-1-line multiplexers and explain its operation by means of a function table. 
Q. 2. Represent the following conditional control statement by two register transfer statements with control functions. 
If (P1) then (R1 <-- R2) else If (Q=1) then (RI <-- R3)
Q. 3. Draw a timing diagram assuming that SC is cleared to 0 at time T3 if control signal C7. is active. 
       C7T3: SC --> 0
  C7 is activated with the positive clock transition associated with T7.

Q.4. An output program resides in memory starting from address 230. It is executed after the computer recognizes an interrupt when FGO becomes a 1 (while IEN = 1). 
(a) What instruction must be placed at address 1?
(b) What must be the last two instructions of the output program?

Q5. The memory unit of a computer has 256K words of 32 bits each. The computer has an instruction format with four fields: an operation code field, a mode field to specify one of seven addressing modes, a register address field to specify one of 60 processor registers. and a memory address. Specify the instruction format and the number of bits in each field if the in instruction is in one memory word.

Q.6. How many times does the control unit refer to memory when it fetches and executes an indirect addressing mode instruction if the instruction is
(a) a computational type requiring an operand from memory;
(b) a branch type.
Explain with the help of an example.

Q.7. Write the RISC 1 instruction in assembly language that will cause a jump to address 3200 if the Z (zero) status bit is equal to 1.
(a) Using immediate mode
(b) Using a relative address mode (assume that PC = 3400)


                               PART C




Q1. An instruction at address 021 in the basic computer has I = 0, an operation code of the AND instruction, and an address part equal to 083 (all numbers are in hexadecimal). The memory word at address 083 contains the operand B8F2 and the content of AC is A937. Go over the instruction cycle and determine the contents of the following registers at the end of the execute phase: PC. AR. DR. AC, and IR. Repeat the problem three more times starting with an operation code of another memory-reference instruction.

(a) Decrement a register
(b) Complement a register
(c) Negate a register
(d) Clear a register to 0
(e) Divide a signed number by 4
(f) No operation.
