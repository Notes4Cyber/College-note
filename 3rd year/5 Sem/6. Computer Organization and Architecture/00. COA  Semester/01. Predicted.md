### **Part A – (2 Marks Each)**  

1. **Define Register Transfer Language (RTL).**  
   - Register Transfer Language (RTL) is a symbolic notation used to describe the operations and data flow between registers in a computer system. It represents how data moves and is processed within the CPU at the register level.  

2. **What is the purpose of a bus in a computer system?**  
   - A bus is a communication pathway used for data transfer between different components of a computer system, such as the CPU, memory, and I/O devices. It helps in reducing the number of pathways needed for communication and enhances system efficiency.  

3. **Explain the concept of Arithmetic Micro-Operations.**  
   - Arithmetic micro-operations are basic operations performed on numeric data stored in registers. These operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which are executed at the micro-operation level in a processor.  

4. **List the types of Shift Micro-Operations.**  
   - The types of shift micro-operations are:  
     1. Logical Shift (Left and Right)  
     2. Arithmetic Shift (Left and Right)  
     3. Circular Shift (Rotate Left and Rotate Right)  

5. **Define an instruction cycle.**  
   - An instruction cycle is the process by which a CPU fetches, decodes, executes an instruction, and stores the result. It consists of four main phases: Fetch, Decode, Execute, and Write-back.  

6. **What is the difference between register-reference and memory-reference instructions?**  
   - **Register-reference instructions** operate on CPU registers without accessing memory, using direct register operations.  
   - **Memory-reference instructions** involve data transfer between the CPU and memory, requiring memory address referencing.  

7. **Explain the role of stack organization in CPU design.**  
   - Stack organization in CPU design enables efficient function calls and return operations by using a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure. It supports automatic parameter passing, local variable storage, and recursion management.  

8. **What are the key characteristics of RISC architecture?**  
   - The key characteristics of **Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)** architecture are:  
     - Simple and fixed-length instructions  
     - Load/store architecture (separate memory and ALU operations)  
     - Large number of general-purpose registers  
     - Pipelining for parallel instruction execution  
     - Reduced number of addressing modes  

9. **Define pipelining in computer architecture.**  
   - Pipelining is a technique used in processors where multiple instruction stages (fetch, decode, execute, and write-back) are executed simultaneously in different pipeline stages, improving instruction throughput and CPU performance.  

10. **What is the significance of cache memory in a computer system?**  
   - Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory located close to the CPU that stores frequently accessed data and instructions. It significantly reduces access time compared to main memory (RAM), improving overall system performance.  

 




### **Part B – (5 Marks Each)**  

1. **Explain the difference between Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit (ALU) and Arithmetic Unit.**  
   - **Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit (ALU)** is a component of the CPU responsible for performing arithmetic, logical, and shift operations. It is a combination of an arithmetic unit and a logic unit that allows the execution of complex operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and shift operations.  
   - **Arithmetic Unit**, on the other hand, is a subset of the ALU that specifically handles arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, without involving logical or shift operations.  
   - **Key Differences:**
     - The ALU performs both arithmetic and logical operations, while the arithmetic unit handles only arithmetic operations.
     - The ALU is more complex as it includes logical and shift operations, whereas the arithmetic unit focuses only on numerical computations.
     - The ALU is a core part of modern processors, while the arithmetic unit alone is used in simpler hardware like calculators.  

2. **Describe the different types of addressing modes with examples.**  
   Addressing modes define how an instruction identifies the location of data to be processed. The main types include:  
   - **Immediate Addressing Mode**: The operand is directly specified in the instruction.  
     - Example: `MOV A, #5` (Move the value 5 into register A)  
   - **Direct Addressing Mode**: The instruction specifies the memory address where the operand is stored.  
     - Example: `MOV A, 5000H` (Move the value from memory address 5000H to register A)  
   - **Indirect Addressing Mode**: The address of the operand is stored in a register.  
     - Example: `MOV A, @R1` (Move the value from the memory location stored in R1 to A)  
   - **Register Addressing Mode**: The operand is stored in a register, and the instruction directly refers to the register.  
     - Example: `ADD A, B` (Add the value of register B to register A)  
   - **Indexed Addressing Mode**: The operand address is determined by adding an index register to a base address.  
     - Example: `MOV A, [BX + SI]` (Move the value from an address formed by BX + SI into A)  
   - **Relative Addressing Mode**: The operand address is given relative to the current program counter (PC).  
     - Example: `JMP +5` (Jump to the instruction 5 locations ahead)  

3. **Explain how Booth’s multiplication algorithm works with an example.**  
   Booth’s algorithm is an efficient multiplication algorithm for binary numbers that handles signed numbers using 2’s complement representation. It reduces the number of required operations by encoding consecutive 1s in the multiplier efficiently.  
   **Steps of Booth’s Algorithm:**  
   - Append an extra bit (`Q-1`) initialized to 0.  
   - Check the last two bits (`Q0` and `Q-1`):
     - `10` → Subtract the multiplicand from the accumulator.  
     - `01` → Add the multiplicand to the accumulator.  
     - `00` or `11` → No operation.  
   - Perform an arithmetic right shift (ARS).  
   - Repeat until all bits are processed.  

   **Example: Multiply 5 (0101) and -3 (1101 in 2’s complement, 4-bit representation)**  
   - Initial values:  
     ```
     A = 0000  (Accumulator)  
     Q = 1101  (Multiplier -3)  
     Q-1 = 0  
     ```
   - Step-wise execution follows the Booth algorithm rules to compute the result.  

4. **What is Direct Memory Access (DMA), and why is it important?**  
   - **Direct Memory Access (DMA)** is a feature that allows peripherals to transfer data directly to and from memory without involving the CPU.  
   - **Importance of DMA:**  
     - Reduces CPU load, allowing it to perform other tasks while data transfer occurs.  
     - Enables high-speed data transfer between memory and peripherals.  
     - Improves system efficiency, especially in multimedia, networking, and disk operations.  

5. **Describe Flynn’s taxonomy and its classification of computer architectures.**  
   Flynn’s taxonomy classifies computer architectures based on instruction and data streams:  
   - **Single Instruction, Single Data (SISD):** Traditional uniprocessor system, executes one instruction on one data at a time.  
   - **Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD):** One instruction operates on multiple data simultaneously (e.g., vector processors, GPUs).  
   - **Multiple Instruction, Single Data (MISD):** Rare, multiple processors work on the same data stream using different instructions.  
   - **Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data (MIMD):** Used in parallel computing, where multiple processors execute different instructions on different data (e.g., multicore processors, distributed systems).  

6. **Explain instruction pipeline and its advantages.**  
   - **Instruction pipelining** is a technique used in processors to improve execution speed by breaking down instruction execution into multiple stages (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Write-back) and processing different instructions simultaneously at different stages.  
   - **Advantages of Instruction Pipelining:**  
     - **Increases throughput:** Multiple instructions are processed at once.  
     - **Efficient resource utilization:** CPU components remain busy rather than idle.  
     - **Reduces instruction cycle time:** Faster execution compared to sequential processing.  
     - **Improves overall system performance.**  

7. **Discuss the different modes of input-output data transfer in a computer system.**  
   - **Programmed I/O:** CPU actively monitors and controls data transfer between peripherals and memory. Used for simple devices but inefficient due to CPU involvement.  
   - **Interrupt-Driven I/O:** CPU initiates a transfer and continues other tasks until interrupted by the device, reducing CPU waiting time.  
   - **Direct Memory Access (DMA):** A dedicated controller manages data transfer between memory and peripherals without CPU intervention, allowing high-speed data movement.  

 





### **Part C – (10 Marks Each)**  

### **1. Explain in detail the Instruction Cycle with a neat diagram.**  
The **Instruction Cycle** is the sequence of operations the CPU follows to fetch, decode, execute, and store instructions. It consists of four main phases:  

1. **Fetch Cycle:**  
   - The CPU fetches the instruction from memory using the **Program Counter (PC)**.  
   - The instruction is loaded into the **Instruction Register (IR)**.  
   - The PC is incremented to point to the next instruction.  

2. **Decode Cycle:**  
   - The **Control Unit (CU)** decodes the instruction in the IR.  
   - The CPU identifies the type of operation and the required operands.  

3. **Execute Cycle:**  
   - The ALU performs arithmetic or logic operations based on the instruction.  
   - The data is retrieved from registers or memory.  

4. **Write-back Cycle:**  
   - The result of execution is written back to memory or a register.  

**Diagram of Instruction Cycle:**  
```
        +------------+   
        | Fetch      |  
        | Instruction|  
        +------------+  
              |  
              V  
        +------------+  
        | Decode     |  
        | Instruction|  
        +------------+  
              |  
              V  
        +------------+  
        | Execute    |  
        | Instruction|  
        +------------+  
              |  
              V  
        +------------+  
        | Write-back |  
        | Result     |  
        +------------+  
```
The instruction cycle repeats for every new instruction, ensuring continuous program execution.

### **2. Describe the design of a basic computer and its key components.**  
A **basic computer** consists of key components that enable it to process and execute instructions.  

#### **Key Components:**  
1. **Control Unit (CU):** Directs operations by interpreting instructions.  
2. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs arithmetic and logical operations.  
3. **Memory Unit (RAM/ROM):** Stores data and instructions.  
4. **Registers:** Temporary storage locations for fast access.  
5. **Input/Output Devices:** Interfaces for communication with external devices.  
6. **Buses (Data, Address, Control):** Transfer data, addresses, and control signals between components.  

#### **Diagram of Basic Computer:**  
```
    +-------------------+
    |   Input Devices   |
    +-------------------+
            |
            V
    +-------------------+
    |   Control Unit    |
    +-------------------+
            |
    +-------------------+
    |      ALU         |
    +-------------------+
            |
    +-------------------+
    |   Memory Unit    |
    +-------------------+
            |
            V
    +-------------------+
    |   Output Devices  |
    +-------------------+
```  
This design ensures data flows efficiently between components for processing and execution.

### **3. Discuss the working principle of an array multiplier with a suitable example.**  
An **Array Multiplier** is a combinational circuit used for fast multiplication of binary numbers using multiple adders arranged in an array-like structure.  

#### **Working Principle:**  
- **Binary multiplication** follows the same principle as decimal multiplication, using bitwise AND and addition.  
- Each bit of the multiplier is ANDed with all bits of the multiplicand to produce partial products.  
- The partial products are then added using **binary adders (half-adders and full-adders).**  
- The final sum represents the multiplication result.  

#### **Example: Multiplication of 101 (5) and 011 (3)**  
```
       101  (Multiplicand)
   ×   011  (Multiplier)
  ------------
       101   (Partial Product 1, Shift 0)
  +   1010   (Partial Product 2, Shift 1)
  ------------
      1111   (Final Result = 15)
```  
The array multiplier is highly efficient and widely used in hardware multipliers.

### **4. Explain Virtual Memory and discuss how page replacement algorithms work.**  
**Virtual Memory** is a memory management technique that allows the execution of programs larger than physical RAM by using disk space as an extension of RAM.  

#### **How Virtual Memory Works:**  
- The OS divides memory into fixed-sized **pages** and maps them to **frames** in RAM.  
- When a required page is not in RAM, a **page fault** occurs, and the page is loaded from the disk.  
- The OS uses **Page Replacement Algorithms** to decide which page to remove from RAM when new pages are needed.  

#### **Page Replacement Algorithms:**  
1. **FIFO (First-In-First-Out):** Removes the oldest page in memory.  
   - Simple but may replace frequently used pages.  
2. **LRU (Least Recently Used):** Replaces the page that hasn’t been used for the longest time.  
   - Efficient but requires additional memory for tracking usage.  
3. **Optimal (OPT):** Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period in the future.  
   - Ideal but impractical since future use is unknown.  
4. **Clock Algorithm (Second Chance):** A modification of FIFO that gives pages a second chance before replacement.  

Virtual memory improves multitasking and allows programs to run efficiently with limited RAM.  

---

### **5. Compare and contrast RISC and CISC architectures in detail.**  

| Feature | **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)** | **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)** |
|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Instruction Set** | Small, simple, fixed-length | Large, complex, variable-length |
| **Execution Time** | Executes instructions in a single clock cycle | Takes multiple cycles per instruction |
| **Instruction Format** | Few addressing modes, uniform format | Many addressing modes, varied formats |
| **Registers** | Large number of registers | Fewer registers |
| **Memory Access** | Load/store architecture (separate memory and ALU operations) | Direct memory operations |
| **Pipelining** | Highly efficient, easy to implement | Difficult to implement |
| **Hardware Complexity** | Simple control unit, more focus on software optimization | Complex control unit, more focus on hardware |
| **Code Size** | Larger due to simple instructions | Smaller due to complex instructions |
| **Examples** | ARM, MIPS, PowerPC | x86, Intel 8086, Motorola 68000 |

#### **Key Differences:**  
- **RISC is optimized for speed** by executing simple instructions quickly, whereas **CISC focuses on reducing the number of instructions** by using complex multi-cycle operations.  
- **RISC is better for modern pipelined CPUs**, while **CISC is used in legacy systems and high-performance computing.**

9. **What is the function of an Input-Output Processor (IOP)?**  
   - An **IOP** is a specialized processor that manages I/O operations independently of the CPU, reducing CPU workload and improving system efficiency.  

10. **Explain the significance of instruction format in CPU design.**  
   - **Instruction format** defines the structure of machine instructions, including opcode, operand(s), and addressing modes. It impacts CPU efficiency, memory utilization, and instruction decoding speed.  




 ### **Part B – (5 Marks Each)**  

#### **11. Describe different types of computer registers and their roles.**  
Registers are high-speed memory locations inside the CPU used for temporary storage of instructions and data. The key types of registers include:  

1. **General-Purpose Registers (GPRs):** Used for arithmetic, logic, and data manipulation operations. Example: `AX`, `BX` in x86 architecture.  
2. **Special-Purpose Registers:** Designed for specific tasks, including:  
   - **Program Counter (PC):** Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.  
   - **Instruction Register (IR):** Stores the current instruction being executed.  
   - **Memory Address Register (MAR):** Holds the memory address to be accessed.  
   - **Memory Data Register (MDR):** Stores the data being transferred to/from memory.  
   - **Accumulator (AC):** Stores intermediate results of arithmetic and logic operations.  
   - **Stack Pointer (SP):** Points to the top of the stack in memory.  
   - **Status Register (Flags Register):** Stores condition flags such as zero, carry, overflow, etc.  

Registers play a critical role in speeding up computations and reducing access times compared to memory.  

---

#### **12. Explain how the timing and control unit functions in a basic computer.**  
The **Timing and Control Unit** is responsible for coordinating the execution of instructions by generating control signals. Its functions include:  

1. **Clock Generation:** Synchronizes all CPU operations with a clock signal.  
2. **Instruction Decoding:** Interprets instructions stored in the Instruction Register (IR).  
3. **Control Signal Generation:** Sends signals to different components like ALU, memory, and I/O to perform operations.  
4. **Micro-Operation Control:** Breaks down each instruction into a sequence of smaller steps (micro-operations).  
5. **Synchronization of Data Flow:** Manages data transfer between registers, memory, and I/O devices.  

The control unit operates in two ways:  
- **Hardwired Control:** Uses fixed logic circuits for instruction execution (fast but less flexible).  
- **Microprogrammed Control:** Uses a control memory to store sequences of microinstructions (more flexible but slower).  

---

#### **13. Describe the different types of memory in a computer system and their hierarchy.**  
The memory hierarchy is structured based on speed, cost, and capacity:  

1. **Registers:**  
   - Fastest memory located in the CPU.  
   - Used for temporary storage of operands and instructions.  

2. **Cache Memory:**  
   - Small, high-speed memory that stores frequently accessed data from main memory.  
   - Improves CPU performance by reducing access time.  

3. **Main Memory (RAM):**  
   - Used for storing active programs and data.  
   - Types:  
     - **DRAM (Dynamic RAM):** Slower, requires periodic refreshing.  
     - **SRAM (Static RAM):** Faster, used for cache memory.  

4. **Secondary Storage (HDD/SSD):**  
   - Non-volatile, stores data permanently.  
   - Slower than RAM but larger in capacity.  

5. **Virtual Memory:**  
   - Uses a section of the hard drive as an extension of RAM when physical memory is full.  

6. **Tertiary Storage (Optical Disks, Magnetic Tapes):**  
   - Used for backup and archival storage.  
   - Slowest but cheapest form of storage.  

---

#### **14. Explain the importance of cache memory and how it works.**  
**Cache memory** is a small, high-speed memory that stores frequently accessed data from RAM to reduce CPU access time.  

**Importance of Cache Memory:**  
- Reduces the time needed to access frequently used data.  
- Improves CPU performance by minimizing memory bottlenecks.  
- Bridges the speed gap between the CPU and RAM.  

**How Cache Works:**  
1. When the CPU needs data, it first checks the **cache (cache hit)**.  
2. If the data is not in the cache (**cache miss**), it is fetched from RAM and stored in the cache for future use.  
3. Uses **cache mapping techniques** like **direct mapping, associative mapping, and set-associative mapping** to store data efficiently.  
4. Employs **cache replacement policies** such as **LRU (Least Recently Used)** or **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** when cache is full.  

Cache memory significantly enhances processing speed and overall system efficiency.  

---

#### **15. Describe the concept of instruction-level parallelism (ILP).**  
**Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP)** refers to the ability of a processor to execute multiple instructions simultaneously by overlapping their execution.  

**Types of ILP:**  
1. **Pipelining:** Divides instruction execution into stages (fetch, decode, execute, write-back).  
2. **Superscalar Architecture:** Uses multiple execution units to process several instructions per clock cycle.  
3. **Out-of-Order Execution:** Allows instructions to be executed in a different order than they appear in the program to maximize resource usage.  
4. **Speculative Execution:** Executes instructions ahead of time based on branch predictions.  

ILP improves CPU performance by increasing instruction throughput and reducing execution time.  

---

#### **16. Explain the role of daisy chaining in priority interrupt handling.**  
**Daisy Chaining** is a method of handling multiple interrupt requests in order of priority.  

**How it Works:**  
1. **Interrupt Requests (IRQs) are connected in series** from the highest to the lowest priority device.  
2. The **CPU checks the first device** in the chain. If it has an interrupt, it is serviced first.  
3. If the first device does not require servicing, the signal is passed to the next device in line.  
4. This continues until the device with the highest priority needing service is identified.  
5. Once serviced, control is returned to normal execution.  

**Advantages:**  
- Simple hardware implementation.  
- Ensures high-priority devices are serviced first.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Devices with lower priority may experience longer delays.  

---

#### **17. What are the different types of memory mapping techniques used in virtual memory?**  
Memory mapping techniques in virtual memory allow efficient management of physical and virtual memory spaces. The main techniques are:  

1. **Paging:**  
   - Divides memory into fixed-size pages (4KB, 8KB, etc.).  
   - Each process has a page table that maps virtual pages to physical frames.  
   - Reduces fragmentation but adds overhead in managing the page table.  

2. **Segmentation:**  
   - Divides memory into variable-sized segments based on logical program structure (code, stack, heap).  
   - Each segment has a **segment table** mapping virtual to physical addresses.  
   - More flexible but may lead to external fragmentation.  

3. **Paging + Segmentation (Hybrid Approach):**  
   - Combines segmentation for logical structuring and paging for efficient memory management.  
   - Used in modern operating systems like Linux and Windows.  

4. **Direct Mapping:**  
   - Maps virtual addresses directly to physical memory without page tables.  
   - Used in embedded systems where speed is crucial.  

Each technique has its trade-offs in terms of speed, fragmentation, and memory utilization.

#### **Concept of Addressing Modes:**  
Addressing modes determine how an operand (data) is accessed in an instruction. They allow flexibility in programming and efficient memory utilization.  

#### **Types of Addressing Modes:**  

1. **Immediate Addressing Mode:**  
   - The operand is directly specified in the instruction.  
   - **Example:** `MOV R1, #5` (Moves value 5 into register R1).  
   - **Advantage:** Fast execution.  
   - **Disadvantage:** Limited by instruction size.  

2. **Register Addressing Mode:**  
   - The operand is stored in a register.  
   - **Example:** `ADD R1, R2` (Adds values in R1 and R2, storing the result in R1).  
   - **Advantage:** Fastest memory access.  
   - **Disadvantage:** Limited by the number of registers.  

3. **Direct Addressing Mode:**  
   - The instruction contains the memory address of the operand.  
   - **Example:** `LOAD R1, 1000` (Loads data from memory location 1000 into R1).  
   - **Advantage:** Simple addressing.  
   - **Disadvantage:** Limited address space.  

4. **Indirect Addressing Mode:**  
   - The instruction contains a memory address that holds another memory address.  
   - **Example:** `LOAD R1, (1000)` (Loads data from the address stored at location 1000).  
   - **Advantage:** Allows access to large address spaces.  
   - **Disadvantage:** Slower due to multiple memory accesses.  

5. **Indexed Addressing Mode:**  
   - A base address and an index register are used to compute the effective address.  
   - **Example:** `MOV R1, (Base + Index)` (Effective address = Base + Index value).  
   - **Advantage:** Useful for arrays and loops.  

6. **Relative Addressing Mode:**  
   - The effective address is calculated by adding an offset to the Program Counter (PC).  
   - **Example:** `JUMP 20` (Moves to the instruction located at PC + 20).  
   - **Advantage:** Commonly used in branch instructions.  

Each addressing mode has specific use cases based on the requirement of the instruction.

### **19. Explain Booth’s Multiplication Algorithm with step-by-step execution.**  

#### **Booth’s Algorithm Overview:**  
Booth’s Algorithm is used for **multiplication of signed binary numbers** using **radix-2 encoding.** It reduces the number of addition and subtraction operations.  

#### **Steps of Booth’s Algorithm:**  
1. **Initialize values:**  
   - **Multiplier (M), Multiplicand (Q), Q₋₁ (previous Q0), and an accumulator (A) set to 0.**  
   - Choose the number of bits required.  

2. **Repeat for n cycles (where n is the number of bits in the multiplier):**  
   - Check the last two bits: `Q0` and `Q₋₁`.  
   - If `Q0Q₋₁ = 10`, perform `A = A - M`.  
   - If `Q0Q₋₁ = 01`, perform `A = A + M`.  
   - Perform **Arithmetic Right Shift (ARS)** of `A, Q, and Q₋₁`.  

3. **After n cycles, A and Q hold the result.**  

#### **Example:** Multiply (-3) × (4) using 5-bit representation.  

| Step | A  | Q  | Q₋₁ | Operation |
|------|----|----|----|------------|
| Init | 00000 | 00100 | 0  | Initialize values |
| 1st  | 11101 | 00100 | 0  | `A = A - M` |
| 2nd  | 11110 | 10010 | 0  | Arithmetic Right Shift |
| 3rd  | 11111 | 01001 | 0  | No operation |
| 4th  | 00001 | 10100 | 0  | `A = A + M` |
| 5th  | 00000 | 11010 | 0  | Final result |

Final answer: **(0001100)₂ = 12 (decimal).**  

Booth’s Algorithm efficiently handles both positive and negative numbers in multiplication.

### **20. Discuss the architecture and working of an Instruction Pipeline.**  

#### **Instruction Pipeline Architecture:**  
Instruction pipelining allows the CPU to execute multiple instructions simultaneously by breaking execution into stages.  

#### **Stages of an Instruction Pipeline:**  
1. **Fetch (F):** Retrieve the instruction from memory.  
2. **Decode (D):** Interpret the instruction and identify the operation.  
3. **Execute (E):** Perform the instruction using ALU or control logic.  
4. **Memory Access (M):** Access data from memory (if needed).  
5. **Write-back (WB):** Store the result in the register.  

#### **Example of Pipelining:**  

| Cycle | Instruction 1 | Instruction 2 | Instruction 3 | Instruction 4 |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1     | Fetch      |             |             |             |
| 2     | Decode     | Fetch       |             |             |
| 3     | Execute    | Decode      | Fetch       |             |
| 4     | Memory     | Execute     | Decode      | Fetch       |
| 5     | Write-back | Memory      | Execute     | Decode      |

This improves performance significantly by keeping different stages busy.  

#### **Advantages:**  
- Increases CPU throughput.  
- Reduces instruction cycle time.  
- Enables parallel execution of multiple instructions.  

#### **Disadvantages:**  
- Pipeline **stalls** can occur due to dependencies.  
- **Branch instructions** may disrupt execution flow.  

Modern processors use techniques like **branch prediction** and **out-of-order execution** to handle pipeline inefficiencies.

### **21. Describe the different types of Input-Output interfaces and their working principles.**  

#### **Types of I/O Interfaces:**  

1. **Programmed I/O:**  
   - CPU directly controls I/O operations using polling.  
   - **Disadvantage:** CPU remains busy waiting for I/O completion.  

2. **Interrupt-Driven I/O:**  
   - CPU is interrupted when I/O is ready, allowing efficient multitasking.  
   - **Advantage:** Reduces CPU idle time.  

3. **Direct Memory Access (DMA):**  
   - A special controller transfers data directly between I/O devices and memory without CPU involvement.  
   - **Advantage:** Faster and efficient.  

4. **Memory-Mapped I/O:**  
   - Uses memory addresses to access I/O devices.  
   - **Example:** Graphics cards use dedicated memory spaces.  

5. **Isolated I/O (Port Mapped I/O):**  
   - Uses special input/output instructions (e.g., `IN`, `OUT`).  
   - **Example:** Peripheral devices like keyboards.  

Each interface is chosen based on performance requirements and hardware constraints.

### **22. Explain the concept of memory hierarchy and compare different memory types used in a computer system.**  

#### **Memory Hierarchy Concept:**  
Memory hierarchy organizes storage based on **speed, cost, and capacity** for efficient data access.  

#### **Comparison of Memory Types:**  

| Memory Type    | Speed | Cost | Capacity | Volatility | Usage |
|---------------|------|------|----------|------------|--------|
| **Registers**  | Fastest | High | Small | Volatile | Temporary data storage in CPU |
| **Cache**      | Very Fast | High | Small | Volatile | Stores frequently accessed data |
| **RAM (Main Memory)** | Fast | Medium | Medium | Volatile | Active programs and data |
| **SSD/HDD**    | Slow | Low | Large | Non-volatile | Permanent storage |
| **Virtual Memory** | Very Slow | Low | Large | Virtual | Extends RAM using disk space |

#### **Key Takeaways:**  
- **Faster memory is more expensive and smaller in size.**  
- **Caching and virtual memory optimize performance and cost balance.**  
- **Efficient memory hierarchy improves CPU performance by reducing access latency.**
