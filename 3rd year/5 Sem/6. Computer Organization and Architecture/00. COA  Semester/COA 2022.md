                                         Part-B

Q.1 Write an assembly programs that can evaluate the expression X=(A*B+C*D)/(E-F) in a machine that supports -
(i) Two-address instruction format
(ii) One-address instruction format
6.2 The following two signed numbers (negative numbers are represented using 2's compliment form are given. Find their product using Booth's algorithm -

Q.3 Derive an expression for the average access time for a single-level cache memory system as well as for a two-level cache memory system.
Q.4 A memory system has a two-level cache memory. Their access time and hit ratio are given to be 15 ns and 45 ns respectively and 80% and 90% respectively. The main memory access time is given to be 200 ns. Assuming that 60% of the accesses are for read and main memory write accesses are 50% slower than read accesses. Find out the average access time. (Assume 200 ns is for memorerea access)  

Q.5 What do you mean by set associative mapping? With a neat diagram, explain its working principle.
Q6. Draw the schematic diagram of the architecture of a single internal CPU, clearly showing the general purpose, special purpose registers and the data path.

Q.1 Explain the state diagram of finite state machine for cache.

Q.2 A computer system has a main memory consisting of 1 M (220) 32-bit words. It also has an 8K words cache organized in the block-set-associative manner, with 2 blocks per set and 64 words per block. Suppose CPU generates the 20-bit Hexadecimal address AB23C to access a 32-bit word, answer the following -
(a) Specify the set number to which the given address maps.
(b) Mention the tag bits in the given address.
