### **Part A – (2 Marks Each)**  

1. **Define Register Transfer Language (RTL).**  
   - Register Transfer Language (RTL) is a symbolic notation used to describe the operations and data flow between registers in a computer system. It represents how data moves and is processed within the CPU at the register level.  

2. **What is the purpose of a bus in a computer system?**  
   - A bus is a communication pathway used for data transfer between different components of a computer system, such as the CPU, memory, and I/O devices. It helps in reducing the number of pathways needed for communication and enhances system efficiency.  

3. **Explain the concept of Arithmetic Micro-Operations.**  
   - Arithmetic micro-operations are basic operations performed on numeric data stored in registers. These operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which are executed at the micro-operation level in a processor.  

4. **List the types of Shift Micro-Operations.**  
   - The types of shift micro-operations are:  
     1. Logical Shift (Left and Right)  
     2. Arithmetic Shift (Left and Right)  
     3. Circular Shift (Rotate Left and Rotate Right)  

5. **Define an instruction cycle.**  
   - An instruction cycle is the process by which a CPU fetches, decodes, executes an instruction, and stores the result. It consists of four main phases: Fetch, Decode, Execute, and Write-back.  

6. **What is the difference between register-reference and memory-reference instructions?**  
   - **Register-reference instructions** operate on CPU registers without accessing memory, using direct register operations.  
   - **Memory-reference instructions** involve data transfer between the CPU and memory, requiring memory address referencing.  

7. **Explain the role of stack organization in CPU design.**  
   - Stack organization in CPU design enables efficient function calls and return operations by using a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure. It supports automatic parameter passing, local variable storage, and recursion management.  

8. **What are the key characteristics of RISC architecture?**  
   - The key characteristics of **Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)** architecture are:  
     - Simple and fixed-length instructions  
     - Load/store architecture (separate memory and ALU operations)  
     - Large number of general-purpose registers  
     - Pipelining for parallel instruction execution  
     - Reduced number of addressing modes  

9. **Define pipelining in computer architecture.**  
   - Pipelining is a technique used in processors where multiple instruction stages (fetch, decode, execute, and write-back) are executed simultaneously in different pipeline stages, improving instruction throughput and CPU performance.  

10. **What is the significance of cache memory in a computer system?**  
   - Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory located close to the CPU that stores frequently accessed data and instructions. It significantly reduces access time compared to main memory (RAM), improving overall system performance.  

 




### **Part B – (5 Marks Each)**  

1. **Explain the difference between Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit (ALU) and Arithmetic Unit.**  
   - **Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit (ALU)** is a component of the CPU responsible for performing arithmetic, logical, and shift operations. It is a combination of an arithmetic unit and a logic unit that allows the execution of complex operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and shift operations.  
   - **Arithmetic Unit**, on the other hand, is a subset of the ALU that specifically handles arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, without involving logical or shift operations.  
   - **Key Differences:**
     - The ALU performs both arithmetic and logical operations, while the arithmetic unit handles only arithmetic operations.
     - The ALU is more complex as it includes logical and shift operations, whereas the arithmetic unit focuses only on numerical computations.
     - The ALU is a core part of modern processors, while the arithmetic unit alone is used in simpler hardware like calculators.  

2. **Describe the different types of addressing modes with examples.**  
   Addressing modes define how an instruction identifies the location of data to be processed. The main types include:  
   - **Immediate Addressing Mode**: The operand is directly specified in the instruction.  
     - Example: `MOV A, #5` (Move the value 5 into register A)  
   - **Direct Addressing Mode**: The instruction specifies the memory address where the operand is stored.  
     - Example: `MOV A, 5000H` (Move the value from memory address 5000H to register A)  
   - **Indirect Addressing Mode**: The address of the operand is stored in a register.  
     - Example: `MOV A, @R1` (Move the value from the memory location stored in R1 to A)  
   - **Register Addressing Mode**: The operand is stored in a register, and the instruction directly refers to the register.  
     - Example: `ADD A, B` (Add the value of register B to register A)  
   - **Indexed Addressing Mode**: The operand address is determined by adding an index register to a base address.  
     - Example: `MOV A, [BX + SI]` (Move the value from an address formed by BX + SI into A)  
   - **Relative Addressing Mode**: The operand address is given relative to the current program counter (PC).  
     - Example: `JMP +5` (Jump to the instruction 5 locations ahead)  

3. **Explain how Booth’s multiplication algorithm works with an example.**  
   Booth’s algorithm is an efficient multiplication algorithm for binary numbers that handles signed numbers using 2’s complement representation. It reduces the number of required operations by encoding consecutive 1s in the multiplier efficiently.  
   **Steps of Booth’s Algorithm:**  
   - Append an extra bit (`Q-1`) initialized to 0.  
   - Check the last two bits (`Q0` and `Q-1`):
     - `10` → Subtract the multiplicand from the accumulator.  
     - `01` → Add the multiplicand to the accumulator.  
     - `00` or `11` → No operation.  
   - Perform an arithmetic right shift (ARS).  
   - Repeat until all bits are processed.  

   **Example: Multiply 5 (0101) and -3 (1101 in 2’s complement, 4-bit representation)**  
   - Initial values:  
     ```
     A = 0000  (Accumulator)  
     Q = 1101  (Multiplier -3)  
     Q-1 = 0  
     ```
   - Step-wise execution follows the Booth algorithm rules to compute the result.  

4. **What is Direct Memory Access (DMA), and why is it important?**  
   - **Direct Memory Access (DMA)** is a feature that allows peripherals to transfer data directly to and from memory without involving the CPU.  
   - **Importance of DMA:**  
     - Reduces CPU load, allowing it to perform other tasks while data transfer occurs.  
     - Enables high-speed data transfer between memory and peripherals.  
     - Improves system efficiency, especially in multimedia, networking, and disk operations.  

5. **Describe Flynn’s taxonomy and its classification of computer architectures.**  
   Flynn’s taxonomy classifies computer architectures based on instruction and data streams:  
   - **Single Instruction, Single Data (SISD):** Traditional uniprocessor system, executes one instruction on one data at a time.  
   - **Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD):** One instruction operates on multiple data simultaneously (e.g., vector processors, GPUs).  
   - **Multiple Instruction, Single Data (MISD):** Rare, multiple processors work on the same data stream using different instructions.  
   - **Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data (MIMD):** Used in parallel computing, where multiple processors execute different instructions on different data (e.g., multicore processors, distributed systems).  

6. **Explain instruction pipeline and its advantages.**  
   - **Instruction pipelining** is a technique used in processors to improve execution speed by breaking down instruction execution into multiple stages (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Write-back) and processing different instructions simultaneously at different stages.  
   - **Advantages of Instruction Pipelining:**  
     - **Increases throughput:** Multiple instructions are processed at once.  
     - **Efficient resource utilization:** CPU components remain busy rather than idle.  
     - **Reduces instruction cycle time:** Faster execution compared to sequential processing.  
     - **Improves overall system performance.**  

7. **Discuss the different modes of input-output data transfer in a computer system.**  
   - **Programmed I/O:** CPU actively monitors and controls data transfer between peripherals and memory. Used for simple devices but inefficient due to CPU involvement.  
   - **Interrupt-Driven I/O:** CPU initiates a transfer and continues other tasks until interrupted by the device, reducing CPU waiting time.  
   - **Direct Memory Access (DMA):** A dedicated controller manages data transfer between memory and peripherals without CPU intervention, allowing high-speed data movement.  

 





### **Part C – (10 Marks Each)**  

### **1. Explain in detail the Instruction Cycle with a neat diagram.**  
The **Instruction Cycle** is the sequence of operations the CPU follows to fetch, decode, execute, and store instructions. It consists of four main phases:  

1. **Fetch Cycle:**  
   - The CPU fetches the instruction from memory using the **Program Counter (PC)**.  
   - The instruction is loaded into the **Instruction Register (IR)**.  
   - The PC is incremented to point to the next instruction.  

2. **Decode Cycle:**  
   - The **Control Unit (CU)** decodes the instruction in the IR.  
   - The CPU identifies the type of operation and the required operands.  

3. **Execute Cycle:**  
   - The ALU performs arithmetic or logic operations based on the instruction.  
   - The data is retrieved from registers or memory.  

4. **Write-back Cycle:**  
   - The result of execution is written back to memory or a register.  

**Diagram of Instruction Cycle:**  
```
        +------------+   
        | Fetch      |  
        | Instruction|  
        +------------+  
              |  
              V  
        +------------+  
        | Decode     |  
        | Instruction|  
        +------------+  
              |  
              V  
        +------------+  
        | Execute    |  
        | Instruction|  
        +------------+  
              |  
              V  
        +------------+  
        | Write-back |  
        | Result     |  
        +------------+  
```
The instruction cycle repeats for every new instruction, ensuring continuous program execution.

### **2. Describe the design of a basic computer and its key components.**  
A **basic computer** consists of key components that enable it to process and execute instructions.  

#### **Key Components:**  
1. **Control Unit (CU):** Directs operations by interpreting instructions.  
2. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs arithmetic and logical operations.  
3. **Memory Unit (RAM/ROM):** Stores data and instructions.  
4. **Registers:** Temporary storage locations for fast access.  
5. **Input/Output Devices:** Interfaces for communication with external devices.  
6. **Buses (Data, Address, Control):** Transfer data, addresses, and control signals between components.  

#### **Diagram of Basic Computer:**  
```
    +-------------------+
    |   Input Devices   |
    +-------------------+
            |
            V
    +-------------------+
    |   Control Unit    |
    +-------------------+
            |
    +-------------------+
    |      ALU         |
    +-------------------+
            |
    +-------------------+
    |   Memory Unit    |
    +-------------------+
            |
            V
    +-------------------+
    |   Output Devices  |
    +-------------------+
```  
This design ensures data flows efficiently between components for processing and execution.

### **3. Discuss the working principle of an array multiplier with a suitable example.**  
An **Array Multiplier** is a combinational circuit used for fast multiplication of binary numbers using multiple adders arranged in an array-like structure.  

#### **Working Principle:**  
- **Binary multiplication** follows the same principle as decimal multiplication, using bitwise AND and addition.  
- Each bit of the multiplier is ANDed with all bits of the multiplicand to produce partial products.  
- The partial products are then added using **binary adders (half-adders and full-adders).**  
- The final sum represents the multiplication result.  

#### **Example: Multiplication of 101 (5) and 011 (3)**  
```
       101  (Multiplicand)
   ×   011  (Multiplier)
  ------------
       101   (Partial Product 1, Shift 0)
  +   1010   (Partial Product 2, Shift 1)
  ------------
      1111   (Final Result = 15)
```  
The array multiplier is highly efficient and widely used in hardware multipliers.

### **4. Explain Virtual Memory and discuss how page replacement algorithms work.**  
**Virtual Memory** is a memory management technique that allows the execution of programs larger than physical RAM by using disk space as an extension of RAM.  

#### **How Virtual Memory Works:**  
- The OS divides memory into fixed-sized **pages** and maps them to **frames** in RAM.  
- When a required page is not in RAM, a **page fault** occurs, and the page is loaded from the disk.  
- The OS uses **Page Replacement Algorithms** to decide which page to remove from RAM when new pages are needed.  

#### **Page Replacement Algorithms:**  
1. **FIFO (First-In-First-Out):** Removes the oldest page in memory.  
   - Simple but may replace frequently used pages.  
2. **LRU (Least Recently Used):** Replaces the page that hasn’t been used for the longest time.  
   - Efficient but requires additional memory for tracking usage.  
3. **Optimal (OPT):** Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period in the future.  
   - Ideal but impractical since future use is unknown.  
4. **Clock Algorithm (Second Chance):** A modification of FIFO that gives pages a second chance before replacement.  

Virtual memory improves multitasking and allows programs to run efficiently with limited RAM.  

---

### **5. Compare and contrast RISC and CISC architectures in detail.**  

| Feature | **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)** | **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)** |
|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Instruction Set** | Small, simple, fixed-length | Large, complex, variable-length |
| **Execution Time** | Executes instructions in a single clock cycle | Takes multiple cycles per instruction |
| **Instruction Format** | Few addressing modes, uniform format | Many addressing modes, varied formats |
| **Registers** | Large number of registers | Fewer registers |
| **Memory Access** | Load/store architecture (separate memory and ALU operations) | Direct memory operations |
| **Pipelining** | Highly efficient, easy to implement | Difficult to implement |
| **Hardware Complexity** | Simple control unit, more focus on software optimization | Complex control unit, more focus on hardware |
| **Code Size** | Larger due to simple instructions | Smaller due to complex instructions |
| **Examples** | ARM, MIPS, PowerPC | x86, Intel 8086, Motorola 68000 |

#### **Key Differences:**  
- **RISC is optimized for speed** by executing simple instructions quickly, whereas **CISC focuses on reducing the number of instructions** by using complex multi-cycle operations.  
- **RISC is better for modern pipelined CPUs**, while **CISC is used in legacy systems and high-performance computing.**
