## **Chapter 2: Register Transfer and Micro-operations**

### **1. What is Register Transfer Language (RTL), and why is it important?**
**Answer:** RTL is a symbolic notation used to describe the transfer of data between registers and the operations performed on data. It is essential as it provides a clear way to specify the internal operations of a computer.

### **2. How do buses facilitate memory transfers?**
**Answer:** Buses are communication pathways that transfer data between registers and memory. A control unit manages data flow through control signals to ensure synchronized operation.

### **3. What are arithmetic micro-operations? Provide examples.**
**Answer:** Arithmetic micro-operations perform basic arithmetic on binary data in registers. Examples include addition (R1 ← R1 + R2), subtraction, increment, decrement, and shift operations.

### **4. What are logic micro-operations?**
**Answer:** These are bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT, used for manipulating individual bits within registers.

### **5. Explain shift micro-operations and their types.**
**Answer:** Shift operations move bits left or right. Types include logical shift, arithmetic shift, and circular shift.

### **6. How does the Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit (ALU) function?**
**Answer:** ALU performs arithmetic, logic, and shift operations using control signals to select the desired operation.

## **Chapter 3: Basic Computer Organization and Design**

### **7. What are instruction codes, and how do they function?**
**Answer:** Instruction codes represent machine-level instructions in binary form, defining operations performed by the CPU.

### **8. Describe the purpose of computer registers.**
**Answer:** Registers are small, fast storage units within the CPU that hold instructions, addresses, and temporary data for processing.

### **9. What is an instruction cycle?**
**Answer:** The sequence of steps required to fetch, decode, execute, and store an instruction in the CPU.

### **10. What are register-reference and memory-reference instructions?**
**Answer:** Register-reference instructions operate on registers, while memory-reference instructions involve accessing memory.

### **11. Explain the role of timing and control in a basic computer.**
**Answer:** The control unit synchronizes CPU operations using clock signals to manage instruction execution.

### **12. What is the role of interrupts in a computer system?**
**Answer:** Interrupts temporarily halt normal execution to handle external events, improving multitasking efficiency.

## **Chapter 4: Central Processing Unit**

### **13. What is general register organization?**
**Answer:** It involves multiple registers within the CPU to store intermediate values and improve efficiency.

### **14. Explain stack organization and its benefits.**
**Answer:** A stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure used for storing return addresses, function calls, and local variables.

### **15. What are addressing modes?**
**Answer:** Addressing modes define how an operand is accessed. Examples include immediate, direct, indirect, and indexed addressing.

### **16. Compare RISC and CISC architectures.**
**Answer:** RISC has a small set of simple instructions, while CISC has complex instructions that perform multiple operations.

### **17. What is program control in CPU design?**
**Answer:** Program control manages the sequence of execution using branching, jumps, and conditional execution.

## **Chapter 5: Pipeline and Vector Processing**

### **18. What is Flynn’s Taxonomy?**
**Answer:** A classification of computer architectures based on instruction and data streams (SISD, SIMD, MISD, MIMD).

### **19. Explain the concept of pipelining.**
**Answer:** Pipelining is an execution technique where multiple instructions are overlapped in execution stages to improve performance.

### **20. How does an arithmetic pipeline work?**
**Answer:** An arithmetic pipeline divides arithmetic operations into smaller sub-operations, processed simultaneously to improve efficiency.

### **21. Describe instruction pipeline execution.**
**Answer:** The instruction pipeline allows instruction fetching, decoding, execution, and write-back to occur simultaneously for multiple instructions.

### **22. What is Booth's multiplication algorithm?**
**Answer:** A technique for efficient binary multiplication using bit-pair recoding to minimize computation steps.

### **23. Explain the division algorithm in computer arithmetic.**
**Answer:** The division algorithm performs binary division using successive subtraction and shifting techniques.

## **Chapter 6: Input-Output Organization**

### **24. What are input-output interface modes?**
**Answer:** Modes include programmed I/O, interrupt-driven I/O, and Direct Memory Access (DMA), used to manage data transfer between CPU and peripherals.

### **25. What is Direct Memory Access (DMA)?**
**Answer:** A technique that allows peripherals to transfer data to memory without CPU intervention, improving efficiency.

### **26. Explain the daisy-chaining priority method.**
**Answer:** A priority scheme where multiple devices are connected in series, and the highest-priority device gains control first.

### **27. What is an Input-Output Processor (IOP)?**
**Answer:** A specialized processor that handles I/O operations independently from the CPU, reducing CPU load.

### **28. Describe the concept of memory hierarchy.**
**Answer:** Memory hierarchy organizes storage types based on speed and accessibility, from registers to secondary storage.

### **29. What is cache memory, and why is it used?**
**Answer:** Cache memory is a high-speed memory that stores frequently accessed data to improve processing speed.

### **30. Explain virtual memory and its advantages.**
**Answer:** Virtual memory uses disk storage to extend main memory capacity, allowing larger programs to run efficiently.
